dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
My personal build of dwm.

dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

This build includes these patches:
autostart
statusallmons
multimon-1-added-monitor-marker-to-bar
multimon-2-added-n-view-wrappers-for-unified-multi-monitor.diff
dwm-fibonacci-6.2
dwm-sticky

The default terminal command runs the script terminal.sh from the .dwm directory. 
Changes as required before compilation. This makes it easier to switch terminals 
without having to wade into the dwm config each time. Several other shortcuts 
and commands exist that are specific to my own systems. Amend as desired.

The build includes these patches of which details can be found at the suckless site 
(https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/):

autostart
statusallmons
multimon-1-added-monitor-marker-to-bar
multimon-2-added-n-view-wrappers-for-unified-multi-monitor.diff
dwm-fibonacci-6.2
dwm-sticky


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.
fonts: Terminus, Iosveka

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
